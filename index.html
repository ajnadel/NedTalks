					<hr />
					<p>TED talks are an increasingly popular phenomenon, and for good reason &ndash; they offer opportunities for people to share their passions and ideas on a global scale. This evening will give students the chance to talk about their own lives, interests, and thoughts to their peers in an organized format. At the first annual <i>NED Conference</i>, students will deliver TED-style talks about innovative and interdisciplinary subjects and see others do the same, which will allow them to broaden their intellectual horizons and learn more about the interests and abilities of their classmates.</p>
